# USYD Team 2 - Interuni Datathon

This is the GitHub repository for USYD Team 2 in 2024 Sydney [Interuni Datathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/1524341028485482). We received Runner's Up (second place) at the end.

The presentation folder contains the final code and slideshow submitted.
The csv folder contains the submission for different models (the best result for each model is taken).
